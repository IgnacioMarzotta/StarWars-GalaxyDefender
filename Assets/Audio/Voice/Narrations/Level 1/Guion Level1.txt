Commander Skywalker, we've located the remnants of the Imperial fleet over the Corellian system.

This is our best chance to take down the Empire once and for all.

Now get in your X-Wing and join the fleet at this coordinates.

And be careful, we have reports of the enemy testing a new version of their star destroyers.
