I remember that day, we were deployed over the Manaan system to chase down some separatist troops.

The war was almost over, the Republic was about to win and bring peace to the galaxy.

We were following Commander Odd Ball's orders. But we certainly didn't expect what was going to happen.

Something we couldn't refuse, that would change the fate of the galaxy. forever.
